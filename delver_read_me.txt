READ MErunning the simulation will at default simulate 1000 hands from the deck.The variables that store data are:flip: flip has two levels 1 or 0 this shows whether or not delver flipped on turn twoflip_3: the same for turn 3 flips.hands: this variable stores all the hands kept by the computer before testing if delver flipped
prob_2: returns the probability of a turn 2 flip. 

I plan on adding additional functionality in the future. But for now the program does its job and tests to see how easy it is to flip delver.
